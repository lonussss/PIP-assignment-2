# NYU Events Scraper

## Executive Summary
This project provides an automated pipeline to collect and clean even data from the [NYU Events Calendar](https://events.nyu.edu/).

**Motivation / Problem Statement:**  
NYU hosts hundreds of events each semester, but browsing them online can be difficult due to fragmented categories, limited filtering, and lack of export options. By building a scraper + validation pipeline, this project makes event data **searchable, analyzable, and reusable** 
Our goals:
- Collect event metadata (title, date/time, location, URL, description).  
- Standardize and validate data quality.  
- Transform into clean JSON/CSV files for downstream applications.  
-  Ensure reliability through retries, deduplication, and flexible output.  

This tool saves time for students, staff, and developers who want structured access to NYUâ€™s event data.
